          <h1>Fun Facts</h1>
          <p>- I can speak two languages, English and Bengali! <br><br> - I actually was in some productions, as Penny's Mom in Hairspray and Ensemble in Bye Bye Birdie and Cats! I've also made my own play for a playwrighting program! <br><br> - I can voice-act! Both male voices and female voices, I tend to voice act whenever I play story video games! <br><br> - I love video games! My first game was a Naruto fighting game on the DS, and then came my Mario phase. Yikes. I tend to go for the plot-driven games with mystery/drama/a cool world-building concept, like Ace Attorney, Danganronpa, Detroit: Become Human, and more! <br><br> - I can code Python, as I have taken a class on it from Feb 2020-June 2020! <br><br> - I am learning Graphic Design right now, having some experience already, as I do it for banners/posters for an internship I'm in called Hideouts!

          <h1>Favorite Food</h1>
          <p> - I have a diverse taste! I love chocolate a whole lot, but I also love savory foods! Seafood is a fav, with shrimp being the best to me! I love fettucini alfredo, and so much more! Ice cream desserts always cheer me up! </p>

          <h1>Hobbies</h1>
          <p> - I actually have been <b>drawing</b> ever since I was 6! I've always loved coloring (it's so calming) and now, I plan to one day get my own comic published! I already post my drawings but it's mainly for fun! I mainly do them in an anime-esque style, but do like exploring sometimes. <br><br> - I love to <b>sing</b>! I was in chorus ever since elementary school, and love musicals a whole lot, so singing has always been a passion. I can sing in both female and male voices (am proud of my range). I also songwrite at times! <br><br> - I definitely love making up stories and characters. I LOVE world building and coming up with concepts, and love seeing it more visually rather than in words (like in plays, or comic form). <br><br> - I watch anime! My first anime was Naruto, but from then on, I began watching more, mainstream and non-mainstream, like Bungou Stray Dogs, Durarara,Fairy Tail, and more!</p>
