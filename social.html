 <h1> <b>My Theater Experience</b> </h1>
 <p1>I've been involved in theater for a while now! I've always been one who wanted to be in the spotlight, and so I tried to get into theater in any way I could!</p1>

   <p>I've been into singing for a long time. I was in chorus ever since elementary school, and now am still in chorus in my high school! I've sung the Star Spangled Banner for my Arista Ceremony in 2018,and sung songs in Chorus such as "All I Want" by Mariah Carey, "Hey Soul Sisters" by Train, and much more! Chorus has always been a fun time for me, even if getting on the risers still scares me if I'm on the top row!<p></div></div></div>

          <p>I was in several musicals! Unfortunately, majority for middle school and elementary were pretty low-budget, but they were fun nonetheless! We had a program called Inside Broadway in IS126Q where actual Broadway actors came to produce a low-budget musical with us for the school. It was a fun program where your ambition really pays off. I was also in a musical production of HairSpray as Penny's Mom!<p>

            <p> In Bronx Science, I was in a musical production for "Bye Bye Birdie" in the ensemble. The musical was very dance heavy and the ensemble honestly loses their voice by the end of each performance (I took many cough drops-). It was very fun, bubbly, and honestly got my inner screaming out!</p>

              <p>S!NG is a completely student-funded, student-run, and student made production within Bronx Science! We fund ourselves, make the plays ourselves, and produce it all ourselves! We tend to have 2 shows because we have 2 scripts, since each show is 1 hour! I been in S!NG the whole time I was in Bronx Science, and I loved it!</p>

              <p> I was casted as a main character in this play for 2020 (we barely made it, the next day after we performed, quarantine hit), and I was the Public Relations Manager, so I was in charge of handling the trailer.</p>
